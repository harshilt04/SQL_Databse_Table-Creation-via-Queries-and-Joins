# SQL_Databse_Table-Creation-via-Queries-and-Joins

I have used **Postgre SQL** and **Pgadmin 4** to create tables and relationships between them.

I have performed different functions and steps in this projects.

**Data Retrieval**: Utilize SELECT statements to retrieve specific data, such as employee information, shop details, and supplier data, ensuring accurate and efficient access to information.

**Data Filtering**: Use WHERE clause to filter data based on specific criteria, such as employee salary, shop location, and supplier type, allowing for targeted analysis.

**Data Aggregation**: Employ aggregate functions like MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM, and COUNT to summarize data, providing valuable insights into employee salaries, shop performance, and supplier statistics.

**Data Modification**: Utilize INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to manage data, ensuring the database reflects the most current information for informed decision-making.

**Data Analysis**: Utilize CASE statements to categorize data, enabling analysis based on salary categories, employee groups, and other relevant factors, aiding in decision-making processes.

**Data Joining**: Use JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables, enabling comprehensive analysis that considers employee, shop, and location information simultaneously.

**Data Subsetting**: Employ subqueries to retrieve specific subsets of data, allowing for detailed analysis of employee demographics, shop performance, and other key metrics.
